# Export to GitHub from Replit

## Step 1: Initialize Git Repository in Replit

1. **Open the version control panel:**
   - Look for the Git/branch icon in the left sidebar (looks like a tree branch)
   - Click it to open the version control panel

2. **Create Git repository:**
   - Click "Create a Git repository" 
   - This initializes version control for your project

## Step 2: Connect to GitHub

1. **Connect GitHub account:**
   - Click "Connect to GitHub" 
   - Sign in to your GitHub account when prompted
   - Authorize Replit to access your GitHub

2. **Create new repository:**
   - Repository name: `bookeo-email-monitor`
   - Description: "Automated email monitoring agent for Bookeo notifications"
   - Make sure it's set to **Public** (required for free Render deployment)
   - Click "Create repository"

## Step 3: Commit and Push Files

1. **Stage your files:**
   - You'll see all your project files listed
   - Click "Stage all" to select all files for upload

2. **Commit changes:**
   - Add commit message: "Initial email monitoring agent setup"
   - Click "Commit & push"

3. **Files uploaded:**
   Your GitHub repository will now contain:
   - All your working email monitoring code
   - Deployment files for Render.com
   - Documentation and setup guides

## Step 4: Verify Upload

1. **Check GitHub:**
   - Go to https://github.com/yourusername/bookeo-email-monitor
   - Verify all files are present
   - Your repository is now ready for Render deployment

## Next Steps After GitHub Setup

Once your code is on GitHub:
1. Go to Render.com and create account
2. Create "Web Service" from your GitHub repository  
3. Configure environment variables (same as your Replit secrets)
4. Deploy for free 24/7 operation

Your working email monitoring agent will transfer exactly to Render with the same functionality - monitoring robot@quantumescapesdanville.com every 2 minutes and sending SMS alerts to 619-917-2605 when Bookeo emails arrive.
